Hierarchy
How does the design guide your focus? What information is highlighted? How does color and text treatment signal the importance of certain elements?

Content
What specific wording was chosen for this experience? What content is visible and more interestingly, what content isnâ€™t? How is spacing used to frame the content?

Intent
Why would someone open this app? What problem does it solve? How could the design help to solve that problem even better?

Audience
Who are the people using this product? How might their use cases be different from yours? How does the design serve these use cases?
